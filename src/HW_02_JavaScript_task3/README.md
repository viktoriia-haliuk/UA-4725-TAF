# Homework 03 - Task 1

**Task3:** Write a JavaScript program to generate a random password of a specified length. You need to define the criteria for a valid password. Here are some recommendations for setting these criteria:
- Determine the minimum length of the password.
- Decide which categories of characters should be represented in the password (for example, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters).
- Consider whether the password should avoid simple sequences or repetitions of characters.


## How to test:
1. Open the file `hw_02_task3.js` in any JavaScript runtime (Node.js or browser console).
2. Run the code.
3. Check the results printed in the console:
   - For length **2** → will show `"Password must be at least 8 characters long"`.
   - For length **8** → should generate a valid random password.
   - For length **15** → should generate a valid random password.
